May Your Kindness Remain by Courtney Marie Andrews
Lyrics from album, May Your Kindness Remain

[Verse 1]
You're a good woman and a good friend
You got a good heart even when it's busted and bent
Lipstick and perfume, under gram queen
Wearing loneliness like a costume for the whole world to see

[Chorus]
And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain

[Verse 2]
Broke on a barstool, throwin' your paycheck away
On overpriced booze, slots, and valet
Fortune might buy diamonds, all shiny and new
But it can't buy you happiness or love, that is true

[Chorus]
And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain

[Verse 3]
The richest of people
Aren't rich with houses, cars, or fame
No they're not rich with something
That can be bought or arranged
No, it's kindness that makes them beautiful
And a kind heart don't cost a dime
It's a gif that keeps giving
For the rest of your life

[Chorus]
And if your money runs out
And your good looks fade
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain
May your kindness remain
Oh, may your kindness remain
