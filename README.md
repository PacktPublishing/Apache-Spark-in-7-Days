## About the Video Course
Apache Spark in 7 days aims to help you quickly get started in learning about this big data processing engine. Starting out with deploying a Spark cluster in AWS cloud with a Python EC2 script, it’ll quickly dive into how you can monitor your Spark job, using a UI dashboard, while running a test script.

The course will then help you to grasp the fundamentals of RDDs, DataFrames and Spark SQL. It goes on to cover machine learning fundamentals and models, demonstrating how to build a data pipeline.  The course ends with the topic on streaming, focusing on the lower level API DStreams and then on higher level API Structured Streaming. By the end of this course you should be able to write basic Spark code using python with excellent speed. It’s ideal for any beginner looking to skill up and to eventually use a cloud service like AWS.
